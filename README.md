# RCM-Artifact
MED-Net for RCM Image Artifact Segmentation and Image Quality Assessment

The model and the code is also used to generate the results presented at our more recent paper titled "Utilizing Machine Learning for Image Quality Assessment for Reflectance Confocal Microscopy" that will be published at [Journal of Investigative Dermatology](https://www.jidonline.org/). The paper link will be made available soon. 

The most up to date version of our more general segmentation method for delineation of 6 different pattern classes that are encountered in the RCM mosaics of melanocytic lesions collected at DEJ is available at [MED-Net](https://github.com/kkose/MED-Net). The technical details of the initial version of the segmentation algorithm was presented at MICCAI'18 conference @ Granada with title: [A Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Network with Partial Label Training for Annotating Reflectance Confocal Microscopy Images of Skin](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_33). A preprint version is available at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02213)

We are working on with our institute's technology office to make the model and the corresponding code available to public. 
Until the code and the model will be made publicly available, -for academic use querries- please contact at kosek@mskcc.org.
